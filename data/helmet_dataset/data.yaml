# Helmet Detection Dataset Configuration
# Association-based violation detection system

# Dataset paths (will be updated for Puffer)
path: ../data/helmet_dataset
train: train/images
val: valid/images
test: test/images

# Number of classes
nc: 2

# Class names
names:
  0: without_helmet
  1: with_helmet

# Class descriptions
# 0: Person wearing helmet (compliant)
# 1: Person not wearing helmet (violation)

# Dataset statistics (update after inspection)
# train_images: TBD
# val_images: TBD
# total_objects: TBD

# Notes:
# - Motorcycle detection uses pre-trained YOLOv8 (COCO class 3)
# - This model focuses on helmet status detection only
# - Association logic connects riders with motorcycles post-detection
